# Azure-DataFlow-Insights-with-Databricks-End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Real-Time-Project

## Project Overview

Azure DataFlow Insights is a comprehensive data engineering solution designed to address critical business needs by leveraging Azure's powerful cloud services. This project demonstrates the implementation of a robust data pipeline that extracts customer and sales data from an on-premises SQL database, transforms it in the cloud, and generates actionable insights through a Power BI dashboard.

## Business Requirements

The project aims to bridge the gap in understanding customer demographics, specifically focusing on gender distribution and its influence on product purchases. Key requirements include:

- Visualization of sales by gender and product category
- Data filtering capabilities by product category, gender, and date
- User-friendly interface for stakeholder queries

## Solution Architecture

The solution is structured into the following components:

### Data Ingestion
- Extract data from on-premises SQL database
- Load data into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) using Azure Data Factory (ADF)

### Data Transformation
- Utilize Azure Databricks for data cleaning and transformation
- Implement Bronze, Silver, and Gold data layers

### Data Loading and Reporting
- Load transformed data into Azure Synapse Analytics
- Create Power BI dashboard for data visualization

### Automation
- Schedule daily pipeline runs for up-to-date insights

## Technology Stack

- Azure Data Factory (ADF)
- Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS)
- Azure Databricks
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Power BI
- Azure Key Vault
- SQL Server (On-Premises)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Azure Environment Setup**
   - Create Resource Group

   - Design Power BI dashboard

5. **Automation and Monitoring**
   - Schedule ADF pipelines
   - Implement monitoring solutions

6. **Security and Governance**
   - Configure RBAC using Azure Entra ID

7. **End-to-End Testing**
   - Validate pipeline functionality
